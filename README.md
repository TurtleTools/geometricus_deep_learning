# Exploring geometric deep learning algorithms with rotation invariant moments for protein structures

### Done:
* Graph representations of proteins with 16 3D-rotation invariant moment descriptors per residue, using Geometricus tool [1]
* Unsupervised graph embeddings using InfoGraph [2] - a contrastive method for graph level representation learning

### To be done:
* Train on AlphaFold 2 structures
* Explore embeddings
* Performance test on protein similarity search
